### Requirements
- Devices need to have the same [public IP](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+my+ip) to see each other.
- Hotspot provider must be a router inorder to handle a maximum of 254 connections in a same network.<br>
- The internet connection is needed till the chat space is accessed &other devices are discovered.<br>
<br>

### Security
SPOT uses a secure and encrypted peer-to-peer connection. This means that this data is never transferred through any intermediate server but directly between the sender and recipient devices. To achieve this, SPOT uses a technology called WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication), which is provided natively by browsers.<br>
- The data transferred is distributed by the host to the co-clients by using WebRTC server, and only the devices in the network can access the chat. More importantly this is absolutely localized and not a single data is given to cloud. <br>
- This also means that's the data shared won't go through any end-to-end encryption technologies and there will be no supervision/moderation controls available in the network. This is built on the hope that everyone will act responsibly in this space.
- Old mobile phones may not function properly due to the technology's limited capabilities.
